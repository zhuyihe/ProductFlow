# Backend Quality Guidelines

> Backend quality standards reflected by Atelier's current code, tests, and tooling.

---

## Tooling

Backend tooling is defined in `backend/pyproject.toml` and root `justfile`:

- Python target: `>=3.12`.
- Ruff line length: `120`.
- Ruff target version: `py312`.
- Ruff lint selections: `E`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, `B`; `B008` is intentionally ignored for FastAPI dependency defaults.
- Pytest discovers tests under `backend/tests/`.

Common commands:

```bash
just backend-test
uv run --directory backend ruff check .
just backend-migrate
just backend-run
just backend-worker
```

Use the root `justfile` where possible so local env loading and ports match the project.

### Scenario: Production-style Docker Compose self-host runtime

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: editing `docker-compose.yml`, Dockerfiles, example env files, or README/docs for the self-hosted runtime.
- Applies to the full Compose stack: PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI API, Dramatiq worker, built Web static server, and shared storage.

#### 2. Signatures

- One-click start: `docker compose up -d --build`.
- Manual migration path: `docker compose run --rm atelier-backend alembic upgrade head`.
- Direct API health: `GET /healthz` returns `{"status":"ok"}`.
- Web proxy smoke path: `GET /api/healthz` through nginx proxies to backend `GET /healthz`.

#### 3. Contracts

- `atelier-backend` and `atelier-worker` must use Compose service names for runtime dependencies:
  - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://atelier:<password>@atelier-postgres:5432/atelier`
  - `REDIS_URL=redis://atelier-redis:6379/0`
- Container storage must use a shared in-container path `STORAGE_ROOT=/app/storage`.
- `STORAGE_HOST_PATH` is host-only Compose interpolation for production bind mounts. When unset, `/app/storage` is backed
  by the named volume `atelier-storage`; when set, it may point at an existing host directory such as
  `/home/cot/Atelier-release/shared/storage` for old systemd production storage reuse.
- Local hot-reload development must stay isolated on `.env.dev` / `STORAGE_ROOT=./backend/storage-dev`; do not depend on
  shell-sourcing production `.env` for development commands.
- Web self-host runtime must serve Vite build output as static files and proxy same-origin `/api/*` to the backend service.
- Runtime must not require host `uv`, `pnpm`, or `just`; those tools are only for local development.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env` -> Compose config/start should fail before launching Postgres.
- Postgres/Redis unhealthy -> backend must wait via `depends_on.condition: service_healthy`.
- Migration failure -> backend container must fail before serving API traffic.
- Backend unhealthy -> worker and web must wait for backend health before starting.
- Web `/api/*` not proxied -> same-origin frontend API calls fail even if static files load.
- Old systemd production files disappear after migration -> check whether `STORAGE_HOST_PATH` was set to the existing host
  storage directory before Compose created/used a fresh named volume.
- `STORAGE_HOST_PATH` leaks into container application config or replaces `STORAGE_ROOT` -> fix Compose env wiring; the app
  should still see `STORAGE_ROOT=/app/storage`.

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `docker compose up -d --build` starts all five services, API health is OK, and web `/api/healthz` returns backend health.
- Good: `STORAGE_HOST_PATH=/home/cot/Atelier-release/shared/storage docker compose up -d --build` bind-mounts old
  production files while API/worker still run with `STORAGE_ROOT=/app/storage`.
- Base: local development starts only `atelier-postgres` and `atelier-redis`, while host `just` commands run API/worker/web.
- Bad: `DATABASE_URL` points at `localhost` from inside containers; that targets the app container itself, not Postgres.
- Bad: setting container `STORAGE_ROOT=/home/cot/Atelier-release/shared/storage`; that host path does not exist inside
  the container and bypasses the stable `/app/storage` contract.
- Bad: using Vite dev server or host `pnpm` as the documented production-style self-host web runtime.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Run `docker compose config --quiet` after Compose/env edits.
- For storage-related Compose changes, render config with `STORAGE_HOST_PATH` both unset and set; assert backend/worker
  mount `/app/storage`, keep `STORAGE_ROOT=/app/storage`, and do not expose `STORAGE_HOST_PATH` in container env.
- Build container images with `docker compose build atelier-backend atelier-web` or a full `docker compose up -d --build` smoke.
- Smoke a disposable or safe project with direct API health, web health, and web `/api/healthz` proxy checks when practical.
- Keep normal backend/frontend gates green when Dockerfiles or docs depend on package commands: backend tests/ruff and frontend lint/test/build.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```yaml
DATABASE_URL: postgresql+psycopg://atelier:password@localhost:15432/atelier
```

Correct:

```yaml
DATABASE_URL: postgresql+psycopg://atelier:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@atelier-postgres:5432/atelier
```

Wrong:

```yaml
environment:
  STORAGE_ROOT: /home/cot/Atelier-release/shared/storage
volumes:
  - atelier-storage:/app/storage
```

Correct:

```yaml
environment:
  STORAGE_ROOT: /app/storage
volumes:
  - ${STORAGE_HOST_PATH:-atelier-storage}:/app/storage
```

### Scenario: Keep Compose release and open-source examples clean

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: editing repository release helpers, example env files, or ignore rules that affect what can be published.
- Applies to `scripts/release.sh`, `justfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `.env.dev.example`,
  `web/.env.example`, `.gitignore`, and `.trellis/.gitignore`.

#### 2. Signatures

- `just release` / `scripts/release.sh` is the single-host Docker Compose production update helper.
- `just release-dry-run` sets `DRY_RUN=1` and must not stop legacy services, build images, start containers, switch
  symlinks, or delete volumes.
- The actual release path validates Compose config, stops legacy user-level systemd services when present, runs
  `docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans`, and performs HTTP health checks.
- Legacy services are `atelier-backend.service`, `atelier-worker.service`, and `atelier-web.service`.
- Supported override: `LEGACY_SYSTEMD_ACTION=skip` skips the legacy service stop step after the operator has handled port
  ownership manually.

#### 3. Contracts

- Example env files must contain placeholders or mock-provider defaults only; never commit real secrets or private hostnames.
- Local env backups such as `.env.bak-*` must stay ignored; they may contain copied production secrets and must not be
  inspected, tracked, or included in open-source release hygiene diffs.
- Release/update helpers must not delete Docker volumes; `docker compose down -v` is only a documented manual reset.
- Dry-run must remain non-switching and non-service-starting while still validating `docker compose config --quiet` and
  showing the real command sequence.
- Release helpers must not shell-source `.env`; use Docker Compose's env parsing for service configuration and read only
  the specific local values needed for health-check URLs without executing the file.
- Compose release must gracefully tolerate missing or inactive legacy systemd services but should try to stop them before
  binding the production ports.
- Keep `.trellis/spec/`, `.trellis/workflow.md`, and `.trellis/scripts/` source-controlled; keep `.trellis/tasks/` and
  `.trellis/workspace/` out of public tracking.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Real token/private key in a tracked or newly added file -> remove it and rotate the secret before publishing.
- Untracked `.env.bak-*` appears in `git status` -> add/verify ignore coverage without reading or modifying the backup
  file content.
- `just release-dry-run` starts/stops services or builds images -> fix immediately; dry-run is for safe planning.
- `just release` fails because old systemd services still occupy 29280/29281 -> ensure the helper stops legacy services or
  clearly reports the port-binding failure.
- `.trellis/tasks/` appears in `git ls-files` -> remove it from the index without deleting the local task context.

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `just release-dry-run` validates Compose config and prints the planned `docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans` flow without side effects.
- Good: `just release` stops legacy services, recreates Compose services, passes backend and web `/api/healthz` checks, and leaves volumes intact.
- Base: `.env.dev.example` uses local service ports and mock providers while allowing contributors to opt into real
  providers by setting their own untracked env file.
- Bad: release script creates tar snapshots, flips a `.release/current` symlink, or restarts `atelier-*.service` after
  Compose has become the production runtime.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Run `bash -n scripts/release.sh` after shell helper edits.
- Run `just release-dry-run` or at minimum `DRY_RUN=1 bash scripts/release.sh` after release helper edits.
- Run `docker compose config --quiet` after Compose/env edits.
- For full release validation when practical, run `just release` and smoke backend `/healthz`, web `/healthz`, and web
  `/api/healthz`.
- Run `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check` before committing release hygiene changes.
- Run a high-confidence secret pattern scan over tracked and newly added files, excluding lockfiles if needed for noise.
- Confirm referenced files and `just` commands exist when README or docs are updated.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```bash
systemctl --user restart atelier-backend.service atelier-worker.service atelier-web.service
```

Correct:

```bash
systemctl --user stop atelier-backend.service atelier-worker.service atelier-web.service || true
docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

## Required Patterns

### Keep provider code behind infrastructure factories

Existing provider selection is centralized in:

- `backend/src/productflow_backend/infrastructure/text/factory.py`
- `backend/src/productflow_backend/infrastructure/image/factory.py`

Routes and use cases call provider interfaces/factories, not concrete SDK classes directly. If adding providers, update the
factory, config definitions, tests, and settings UI types together.

Workflow execution has an additional explicit dependency seam in
`application/product_workflow_dependencies.py`. Default workflow execution dependencies resolve providers directly through
the infrastructure provider factories. Tests and future composition code that need fake providers should pass a
`WorkflowExecutionDependencies` instance directly rather than patching the `product_workflows.py` facade.

#### Scenario: Workflow execution dependency seams

##### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: editing workflow execution provider or renderer construction.

##### 2. Signatures
- `WorkflowExecutionDependencies(text_provider_resolver, image_provider_resolver, poster_renderer_factory)`.
- `run_product_workflow(..., dependencies=None)`, `execute_product_workflow_run(..., dependencies=None)`, and internal
  `_execute_node(..., dependencies=None)` accept this seam without changing API/worker call sites.

##### 3. Contracts
- `None` uses default resolvers that call the infrastructure text/image provider factories.
- The `product_workflows.py` facade exports public workflow use cases for route/worker imports only; it must not expose
  provider factory helpers or private `_...` execution helpers as test seams.
- Custom dependencies may be passed by focused tests or future composition code; they must return provider interface
  instances, not concrete SDK payloads.

##### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Resolver/provider failure -> existing workflow failure handling persists the run/node failure reason.
- Missing image provider for generated mode -> remains a runtime execution failure, not a schema/API change.

##### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: a focused test injects fake providers through `WorkflowExecutionDependencies`.
- Base: route/worker code calls public workflow use cases with `dependencies=None`, and execution resolves providers via
  the infrastructure factories.
- Bad: tests monkeypatch `product_workflows.get_image_provider`, `product_workflows.get_text_provider`, or
  `product_workflows._execute_node`.
- Bad: workflow execution imports a concrete provider SDK class.

##### 6. Tests Required
- Keep provider/workflow regression tests passing after resolver changes.
- Add a focused injection test when changing resolver behavior itself.

##### 7. Wrong vs Correct
Wrong:

```python
provider = OpenAIResponsesImageProvider()
```

Correct:

```python
provider = dependencies.image_provider()
```

Wrong:

```python
monkeypatch.setattr("productflow_backend.application.product_workflows.get_image_provider", fake_factory)
```

Correct:

```python
dependencies = WorkflowExecutionDependencies(image_provider_resolver=fake_factory)
run_product_workflow(session, product_id=product.id, dependencies=dependencies)
```

### Validate inputs at the correct boundary

- FastAPI `Query` constraints are used for list pagination in `presentation/routes/products.py`.
- Upload MIME/size/pixel validation is centralized in `presentation/upload_validation.py`.
- Business text/price normalization lives in `application/use_cases.py` helpers such as `_normalize_required_text(...)` and
  `_normalize_price(...)`.
- Runtime settings normalization lives in `backend/src/productflow_backend/config.py`.

Do not duplicate these checks in multiple pages/routes.

### Scenario: Provider-neutral image generation size contract

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: editing continuous image sessions, workflow `image_generation` node config, runtime image settings, provider image payloads, or frontend image-size controls.
- Applies to the shared `WIDTHxHEIGHT` image-size contract across `ImageChatPage`, workflow Inspector, API schemas, runtime settings, workflow execution, and image providers.

#### 2. Signatures

- Backend canonical normalizer: `normalize_image_generation_size(value: str, *, max_dimension: int | None = None) -> str`.
- Runtime max single-edge setting: `image_generation_max_dimension`.
- Public runtime config API: `GET /api/settings/runtime` returns `image_generation_max_dimension`.
- Built-in presets are application UI constants; runtime settings expose only the max single-edge limit, not a
  user-facing allowed-size preset list.
- Continuous image API request field: `GenerateImageSessionRoundRequest.size`.
- Workflow image node config field: `config_json.size` for nodes with `kind == "image_generation"`.
- Frontend shared picker: `ImageSizePicker` emits normalized lowercase `WIDTHxHEIGHT` strings.

#### 3. Contracts

- Store and pass image size as a provider-neutral lowercase `WIDTHxHEIGHT` string, for example `1024x1024` or `3840x2160`.
- Each side is calibrated to the nearest provider-safe 16-pixel multiple before provider dispatch, for example `1500x800`
  becomes `1504x800`.
- Preset buttons are built-in ratio/tier shortcuts filtered by the runtime max single-edge setting; they are not a backend
  allowlist and are not loaded as arbitrary database-configured options.
- `normalize_image_generation_size(...)` must use `get_runtime_settings().image_generation_max_dimension` unless a focused
  caller/test passes an explicit `max_dimension`.
- Custom dimensions must be validated and calibrated by the backend before provider calls, not only by frontend controls.
- Continuous image generation and workflow image-generation nodes must use the same backend normalizer so their accepted/rejected sizes do not drift.
- Provider adapters should receive the normalized string unchanged unless a provider-specific adapter explicitly documents a conversion.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Bad syntax such as `1024`, `1024*1024`, or missing dimensions -> request/config validation error.
- Non-positive dimensions such as `0x1024` or `1024x-1` -> request/config validation error.
- Dimensions above the project safety bounds -> normalize to a safe calibrated `WIDTHxHEIGHT` before provider dispatch.
- Dimensions that are not divisible by 16 -> normalize to the nearest safe 16-pixel multiple before provider dispatch.
- Uppercase separators/digits such as `3840X2160` -> normalize to lowercase `3840x2160`.
- `image_generation_max_dimension < 512` or `> 8192` -> settings validation error.
- Invalid runtime default image dimensions -> settings validation error instead of silently publishing broken provider defaults.

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `3840x2160` entered in the workflow Inspector is saved as `3840x2160` and reaches the image provider as `image_size="3840x2160"`.
- Base: built-in presets such as `1024x1024`, `2048x2048`, and `3840x3840` render as picker buttons and submit the same canonical string.
- Bad: continuous image sessions accept custom sizes while workflow nodes only apply a loose string normalizer.
- Bad: frontend checks dimensions but backend forwards an oversized custom value to the provider.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Continuous image API tests must cover accepted custom dimensions, rejected malformed/non-positive dimensions, and
  oversized dimensions being stored as calibrated safe output sizes.
- Workflow DAG/API tests must cover node create/update normalization, invalid config rejection, provider input receiving
  the configured custom size, and oversized config being persisted as calibrated safe output size.
- Runtime settings tests must cover invalid default image dimensions and `image_generation_max_dimension` validation when
  validation behavior changes.
- Frontend helper/component tests should cover preset parsing, duplicate normalization, and custom-size round-tripping when picker logic changes.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```python
# Workflow accepts any parseable size while continuous image uses different validation.
size = normalize_image_size(config_json.get("size", "1024x1024"))
```

Correct:

```python
# All image generation entry points share the same safety bounds and canonical form.
size = normalize_image_generation_size(config_json.get("size", "1024x1024"))
```

Wrong:

```tsx
<input value={draft.size} onChange={(event) => onChange({ size: event.target.value })} />
```

Correct:

```tsx
<ImageSizePicker value={draft.size} onChange={(size) => onChange({ size })} presets={imageSizePresets} />
```

### Preserve workflow-level tests

`backend/tests/test_*.py` is the backend regression suite and is split by behavior area. It covers:

- Auth/session behavior.
- Settings API persistence and validation.
- Typed business error and legacy `ValueError` HTTP mapping.
- SQLAlchemy enum value storage.
- End-to-end product/copy/poster workflow.
- Reference image upload/deletion.
- Continuous image-session behavior.
- Alembic upgrade path.
- OpenAI Responses image provider parsing behavior.

When changing product, copy, poster, settings, upload, image-session, provider, or migration behavior, add or update tests
in the matching topic file. Keep cross-cutting builders and polling/login helpers in `backend/tests/helpers.py` rather
than reintroducing a giant all-purpose test module.

When extracting workflow graph business rules, add at least one DB-free unit test for the domain rule in addition to any
API/integration regression. The application/query layer should own SQLAlchemy artifact existence checks; the domain rule
should own pure graph decisions.

### Keep storage safe

Use `LocalStorage` from `backend/src/productflow_backend/infrastructure/storage.py` for storage paths. It resolves relative
paths under the configured root and rejects absolute/path-traversal paths. Do not build download paths manually in routes.

### Keep durable async task semantics idempotent

Durable task creation and workers are designed to avoid duplicate active work and duplicate execution:

- Queue send failures are handled by application submit use cases before returning 503:
  `submit_product_workflow_run(...)` and `submit_image_session_generation_task(...)`.
- Dramatiq actors use `max_retries=0`; application code owns retry state.
- Product workflow runs follow the same durable-delivery rule with `recover_unfinished_workflow_runs(...)`: the
  `workflow_runs` / `workflow_node_runs` tables are authoritative, Dramatiq is only delivery, and duplicate messages must
  no-op for terminal or currently-running runs.
- Continuous image-session generation follows the same durable-delivery rule with
  `image_session_generation_tasks` and `recover_unfinished_image_session_generation_tasks(...)`: `POST
  /api/image-sessions/{id}/generate` creates a queued DB task and returns `202`; worker execution creates the existing
  `image_session_rounds` / `image_session_assets` rows on success, and duplicate terminal messages must no-op.

Preserve these semantics when editing durable task code.

### Scenario: Durable generation task contract

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing any database-durable async path that creates provider-backed image/copy/poster generation
  work, enqueues a Dramatiq message, runs in a worker, or exposes queued/running/failed state through a status API.
- Existing members are intentionally separate business models:
  - `WorkflowRun` plus `WorkflowNodeRun` for product workflow generation;
  - `ImageSessionGenerationTask` for continuous image-session generation.
- New work must extend or reference `domain/durable_generation_tasks.py` before adding a third state machine.

#### 2. Signatures

- Contract home: `domain/durable_generation_tasks.py`.
- Shared enqueue boundary: `application/queue_submission.py::enqueue_or_mark_failed(...)`.
- Shared capacity gates:
  - durable submit compatibility lock: `application/admission.py::ensure_generation_capacity(...)`;
  - worker-time running cap: `application/admission.py::generation_running_capacity_available(...)`.
- Current contracts:
  - `WORKFLOW_RUN_GENERATION_TASK_CONTRACT`;
  - `IMAGE_SESSION_GENERATION_TASK_CONTRACT`.
- Current worker actors:
  - `workers.run_product_workflow_run(workflow_run_id: str)`;
  - `workers.run_image_session_generation_task(task_id: str)`.

#### 3. Contracts

- Database rows are authoritative task state. Redis/Dramatiq messages are delivery attempts only.
- A submit use case must create or reuse a durable row before enqueueing. If queue send fails after a durable row exists,
  it must mark the row failed through the owning model's failure transition and raise `QueueUnavailableError` with
  `任务队列暂不可用，请稍后重试`.
- Worker actors must set `max_retries=0`; application execution entrypoints own failure persistence, retry counters,
  partial-result handling, and terminal status.
- Duplicate delivery must be idempotent. Terminal rows and already-running work must return without provider calls or new
  artifacts. Claims must use a database conditional update for queued-to-running transitions where the model has an
  explicit queued state.
- Startup recovery must inspect durable DB state and then resend delivery only for queued or stale-running work according
  to the model's recovery rules. API startup must not reset recent running work owned by another worker.
- Generation capacity must use the shared DB-backed worker gate. Submit paths create or reuse durable queued rows, while
  worker claims count running work before entering provider execution.
- Status snapshots and queue metadata must be derived from durable rows and first-class result rows, not Redis queue
  length or in-process memory.
- Manual cancel must be an owning durable-row transition. Terminal statuses include `cancelled` where the business model
  supports user cancellation, and duplicate delivery for cancelled rows must no-op.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Queue send failure after durable creation -> durable row is failed, API returns `503`,
  `{"detail": "任务队列暂不可用，请稍后重试"}`.
- Running capacity reached during worker claim -> durable row stays queued, provider is not called, and delivery is
  retried later.
- Duplicate terminal message, including cancelled rows -> no-op, no provider call, no new artifact row.
- Duplicate currently-running message -> no-op; stale-running recovery handles old abandoned work separately.
- Recovery sees queued work -> resend delivery without changing product/provider semantics.
- Recovery sees stale running work -> apply the owning model's documented stale behavior, then resend or fail as
  appropriate.
- Status refresh during generation -> response is reconstructed from DB rows and remains stable across process restart.

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: a new generation path adds a `DurableGenerationTaskContract`, persists a durable queued row, submits through
  `enqueue_or_mark_failed(...)`, gates provider execution with `generation_running_capacity_available(...)`, uses a
  `max_retries=0` actor, and adds recovery/status tests.
- Good: workflow run and image-session task continue using separate tables and business statuses while sharing contract
  constants and checks for active/running/queued semantics.
- Base: workflow run has no task-level queued status; its active run is `running`, while node runs hold queued/running
  execution state. The contract should describe that split instead of forcing a new workflow table shape.
- Bad: adding a new async provider path that creates a row and calls `actor.send(...)` directly without
  `enqueue_or_mark_failed(...)`.
- Bad: enabling Dramatiq automatic retries for generation actors.
- Bad: computing queue position or active state from Redis delivery metadata.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Contract regression: current generation contracts still name distinct durable models and expose the expected
  active/queued/running/terminal statuses.
- Worker actor regression: all generation actors satisfy `actor.options["max_retries"] == 0` through the shared contract
  assertion.
- Enqueue failure regression: mocked send failure marks the durable row failed and returns stable `503`.
- Duplicate-message regression for each durable model: terminal and currently-running messages do not call providers.
- Recovery regression for each durable model: queued/stale-running DB rows are handled according to the owning recovery
  rules.
- Admission/status regression: active/running counts and status snapshots are derived from durable DB rows.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```python
session.add(task)
session.commit()
run_new_generation_actor.send(task.id)
```

This can strand a queued durable row if Redis/Dramatiq delivery fails.

Correct:

```python
task = create_durable_generation_task(session, ...)
enqueue_or_mark_failed(
    task.id,
    enqueue=enqueue_generation_task,
    mark_failed=lambda task_id, reason: mark_generation_task_enqueue_failed(session, task_id, reason),
)
```

Wrong:

```python
@dramatiq.actor(max_retries=3)
def run_generation_task(task_id: str) -> None:
    execute_generation_task(task_id)
```

Correct:

```python
@dramatiq.actor(max_retries=0)
def run_generation_task(task_id: str) -> None:
    execute_generation_task(task_id)
```

#### Scenario: Durable async continuous image-session generation

##### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing `POST /api/image-sessions/{id}/generate`, image-session generation persistence, queue delivery,
  worker execution, admission control, or frontend session detail polling for continuous image chat.
- Continuous image-session generation is a cross-layer async workflow: DB task rows are authoritative, Dramatiq/Redis is
  delivery only, and the frontend reconstructs queued/running/failed state from `ImageSessionDetail`.

##### 2. Signatures

- API: `POST /api/image-sessions/{image_session_id}/generate` returns `202 Accepted` after validation, durable task
  creation, and enqueue; it must not wait for an image provider call.
- API: `POST /api/image-sessions/{image_session_id}/generation-tasks/{task_id}/retry` returns `202 Accepted` after
  resetting a failed retryable task to `queued` and enqueueing the same durable task ID.
- API: `POST /api/image-sessions/{image_session_id}/generation-tasks/{task_id}/cancel` returns
  `ImageSessionDetailResponse` after durably marking an active task `cancelled`.
- DB: `image_session_generation_tasks` stores `session_id`, `prompt`, `size`, `base_asset_id`,
  `selected_reference_asset_ids`, `generation_count`, `status`, progress fields (`completed_candidates`,
  `active_candidate_index`, `progress_phase`, `progress_updated_at`, provider response id/status and metadata),
  `failure_reason`, `result_generation_group_id`, `attempts`, `is_retryable`, `created_at`, `started_at`, and
  `finished_at`.
- Queue: `enqueue_image_session_generation_task(task_id: str)` sends the durable task ID; the worker actor consumes only
  the ID and reloads state from the database.
- Recovery: `recover_unfinished_image_session_generation_tasks(reset_stale_running: bool = False, stale_running_after:
  timedelta | None = None)` re-sends queued tasks and, only for worker startup, handles stale running tasks by comparing
  the cutoff against `progress_updated_at`, falling back to `started_at` for older rows. Tasks with no completed
  candidates may be reset to queued; stale partial-success tasks are marked failed without retry.
- Response DTO: `ImageSessionDetailResponse.generation_tasks` exposes task summaries so route entry/refresh can show
  active or failed generation work without a separate orchestration endpoint.
- Each generation task summary exposes `attempts`, `is_retryable`, and `is_cancelable` so the frontend can decide whether
  to render manual retry/cancel affordances.
- Each generation task summary includes global queue fields: `queue_active_count`, `queue_running_count`,
  `queue_queued_count`, `queue_max_concurrent_tasks`, `queued_ahead_count`, and `queue_position`.
- Queue overview API: `GET /api/generation-queue` returns `active_count`, `running_count`, `queued_count`, and
  `max_concurrent_tasks` for product/workflow surfaces that do not own a specific image-session task.

##### 3. Contracts

- Task statuses are `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`; queued/running rows count toward queue
  overview metadata, while only running rows consume `generation_max_concurrent_tasks` provider capacity.
- The continuous image-session worker actor keeps an internal failsafe Dramatiq `time_limit` via
  `image_session_worker_failsafe_time_limit_minutes`. User-facing stale behavior must be driven by progress heartbeat
  idle recovery, not a hard total task timeout.
- Queue position is computed from durable queued image-session generation task rows ordered by `created_at`. Running tasks
  have no queue position and should be displayed as front-of-queue work.
- New image-session generation work must create a queued task even when all running slots are occupied. The worker claim
  count must be based on running DB rows, not an in-process slot, because API/worker processes may be replicated.
- Queue enqueue failure after task creation must mark the task `failed` (or otherwise return a stable `503`) before the
  route responds; do not strand a queued row that no worker can consume.
- Worker claim must be atomic at the database boundary: update `queued -> running` with a status condition and no-op when
  the row is terminal, already running, or already claimed by another worker.
- Manual cancel sets active tasks to `cancelled`, `failure_reason = "已取消"`, `progress_phase = "cancelled"`, and
  `is_retryable=false`. Workers must re-check durable cancellation around provider execution/save boundaries and return
  without creating new rounds when cancellation is observed.
- Worker failures must retry through application state, not Dramatiq actor retries. Keep
  `run_image_session_generation_task(max_retries=0)`, increment `attempts` on each worker claim, reset the same task to
  `queued` while the finite cap has not been reached, and leave terminal failed tasks `is_retryable=true`.
- On success, create normal `image_session_assets` and `image_session_rounds` rows. Multi-candidate generations still use
  one `generation_group_id` with one round/asset per candidate.
- Retrying a partial-success generation task must preserve `completed_candidates` and `result_generation_group_id`, then
  continue from `completed_candidates + 1`. Already saved candidates must not be regenerated.
- On provider/storage/runtime failure, mark the task `failed` with a generic safe user-facing reason such as
  `图片生成失败，请稍后重试`; never expose provider exception text, API keys, base URLs, local paths, request bodies, or
  tracebacks in API responses.
- The shared public demo workspace stays shared; do not add user/tenant ownership checks as part of this async path unless
  a separate product requirement introduces isolation.

##### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing session -> `404`, `连续生图会话不存在`.
- Invalid `generation_count`, `size`, `base_asset_id`, or selected references -> existing image-session validation errors;
  do not enqueue a task.
- Running generation cap reached by another task -> the new task is still accepted as `queued`; when consumed, the worker
  leaves it queued, records a waiting-for-capacity progress phase, and schedules delayed delivery retry.
- Redis/Dramatiq send failure after DB task creation -> mark task `failed`, then return `503`,
  `任务队列暂不可用，请稍后重试`.
- Manual retry for a non-`failed` task -> `400`, `只有失败的生成任务可以重试`.
- Manual retry for `failed` task with `is_retryable=false` -> `400`, `该生成任务不可重试`.
- Manual cancel for an active task -> task becomes `cancelled`, exits the active queue, and duplicate worker delivery
  no-ops.
- Manual cancel for a terminal succeeded/failed task -> `400`, `已结束的生成任务不能取消`.
- Redis/Dramatiq send failure after manual retry reset -> return `503`, `任务队列暂不可用，请稍后重试`, and keep the task
  failed + retryable so the user can try again.
- Duplicate Redis message for `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `running` task -> no provider call and no new
  round/asset rows.
- API restart with queued retryable task -> re-enqueue without changing task semantics.
- Worker restart with stale running retryable task and no completed candidates -> reset to queued and re-enqueue.
- Worker restart with stale running partial-success task -> mark failed without retry, keeping the partial
  `result_generation_group_id`.

##### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: user requests 3 candidates; route returns `202` quickly with a queued task, worker later creates 3 generated
  assets and 3 rounds sharing one `generation_group_id`, then marks the task `succeeded`.
- Good: browser refreshes during generation; `ImageSessionDetail.generation_tasks` still contains queued/running task
  state, so the frontend resumes polling and disables duplicate submission.
- Base: worker receives the same task ID after the task already succeeded; it exits without calling the provider.
- Bad: route calls `generate_image_session_round(...)` or an image provider directly and holds the HTTP request open.
- Bad: active generation cap checks a process-local counter or lock; replicated API processes can exceed the public demo
  cap.
- Bad: worker claim reads a queued task, mutates the ORM object, and commits without a conditional `WHERE status='queued'`;
  concurrent duplicate messages may both call the provider.

##### 6. Tests Required

- Route/API test: submit generation returns `202`, persists a queued task, exposes the task in session detail, and does not
  call the provider synchronously.
- Enqueue failure test: mocked send failure marks the task failed and returns stable `503`.
- Worker success test: executing a queued task creates expected assets/rounds and marks the task succeeded with
  `result_generation_group_id`.
- Worker failure test: provider exception marks the task failed with a generic reason and does not leak the raw exception.
- Auto retry cap test: repeated provider failure calls the provider only up to the finite application cap, then leaves the
  task failed + retryable with `attempts` exposed in detail/status responses.
- Manual retry route tests: failed retryable task resets to queued and enqueues; non-failed retry returns `400`; enqueue
  failure returns `503` and keeps the task retryable.
- Manual cancel route tests: active task becomes `cancelled`, terminal task cancellation is rejected, and duplicate worker
  delivery no-ops for cancelled tasks.
- Partial retry test: a task that saved candidate 1/2 and failed resumes at candidate 2 without duplicating candidate 1 or
  changing the existing `generation_group_id`.
- Duplicate/no-op tests: terminal and already-running task messages do not call the provider or create extra rounds.
- Recovery tests: queued tasks are re-sent; stale running recovery uses `progress_updated_at`, falls back to `started_at`,
  and fails stale partial-success tasks instead of retrying them.
- Admission test: submit accepts queued work while running capacity is full, worker capacity checks count running durable
  work, and queue metadata still reports active queued/running counts.
- Queue metadata test: queued task responses expose `queued_ahead_count` / `queue_position`, and the global overview
  counts active queued/running durable work.
- Frontend gate: update DTO types and run `just web-build` when `ImageSessionDetail` or task status rendering changes.

##### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```python
# HTTP request waits for provider and uses process-local admission state.
with admit_synchronous_generation(session):
    detail = generate_image_session_round(session, image_session_id, request.prompt, storage=storage)
```

Correct:

```python
# HTTP request persists durable work, sends delivery message, and returns 202.
task = create_image_session_generation_task(session, image_session_id, request)
enqueue_image_session_generation_task(task.id)
```

Wrong:

```python
task = session.get(ImageSessionGenerationTask, task_id)
if task.status == JobStatus.QUEUED:
    task.status = JobStatus.RUNNING
    session.commit()
    call_provider()
```

Correct:

```python
updated = session.execute(
    update(ImageSessionGenerationTask)
    .where(
        ImageSessionGenerationTask.id == task_id,
        ImageSessionGenerationTask.status == JobStatus.QUEUED,
    )
    .values(status=JobStatus.RUNNING, started_at=now_utc())
)
if updated.rowcount != 1:
    return
call_provider()
```

Wrong:

```python
@dramatiq.actor(max_retries=3)
def run_image_session_generation_task(task_id: str) -> None:
    execute_image_session_generation_task(task_id)
```

Correct:

```python
@dramatiq.actor(max_retries=0)
def run_image_session_generation_task(task_id: str) -> None:
    execute_image_session_generation_task(task_id)
```

## Testing Requirements

Run at least these checks for backend changes:

```bash
uv run --directory backend ruff check .
just backend-test
```

For schema changes, also run:

```bash
just backend-migrate
```

and add/update an Alembic revision under `backend/alembic/versions/`. Existing tests should continue to cover both
`Base.metadata.create_all(...)` fixtures and Alembic upgrade behavior.

## Forbidden Patterns

- Business logic in FastAPI route handlers beyond input adaptation, use-case calls, error mapping, and serialization.
- Provider-specific SDK calls from `presentation/` modules.
- New database columns or tables without an Alembic migration.
- Enum string changes without updating frontend types and regression tests.
- Unbounded list endpoints that load all rows for UI lists.
- Raw filesystem access for user-controlled storage paths; go through `LocalStorage.resolve(...)`.
- Broad `except Exception` that hides failures. Existing broad catches are narrow boundary cases:
  durable queue enqueue failure inside application submit helpers, config table bootstrap tolerance in `config.py`, and
  provider error classification in application/provider code.
- Committing generated storage, cache directories, `.env`, build output, or pycache files.

---

## Review Checklist

When reviewing backend changes, check:

- Does the change respect the presentation/application/domain/infrastructure layer split?
- Are Pydantic DTOs in `presentation/schemas/` and frontend types in `web/src/lib/types.ts` still aligned?
- Are database model changes mirrored by Alembic migrations and tests?
- Are enum values stored/returned as stable lowercase string values?
- Are uploads, image sizes, and storage paths still bounded?
- Are durable workflow/image-session task failures persisted and visible through their owning status/detail APIs?
- Are provider secrets hidden from API responses and logs?
- Do `uv run --directory backend ruff check .` and `just backend-test` pass?
