# Frontend Product Workbench DAG Guidelines

> Frontend contracts for the product detail node workbench.

## Scenario: Product detail DAG workbench UI

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: any ProductDetail page change that renders, edits, runs, or consumes product workflow DAG data.
- This feature spans API DTOs, TanStack Query cache keys, local selected-node state, and artifact previews.

### 2. Signatures

- API methods live only in `web/src/lib/api.ts`:
  - `getProductWorkflow(productId)`
  - `createWorkflowNode(productId, input)`
  - `updateWorkflowNode(nodeId, input)`
  - `updateWorkflowNodeCopy(nodeId, input)`
  - `uploadWorkflowNodeImage(nodeId, input)`
  - `bindWorkflowNodeImage(nodeId, { source_asset_id? , poster_variant_id? })`
  - `createWorkflowEdge(productId, input)`
  - `deleteWorkflowEdge(edgeId)`
  - `runProductWorkflow(productId, input?)`
- DTOs live only in `web/src/lib/types.ts`: `ProductWorkflow`, `WorkflowNode`, `WorkflowEdge`, `WorkflowRun`,
  `WorkflowNodeRun`.
- Query key: `['product-workflow', productId]`.

### 3. Contracts

- Frontend keeps backend `snake_case` fields (`node_type`, `config_json`, `output_json`, `start_node_id`).
- Supported user-facing node types are `product_context`, `reference_image`, `copy_generation`, and `image_generation`.
- Product detail/workbench is canvas-first: product context, reference slots, copy, and image generation are graph nodes,
  not permanent fixed columns.
- ProductDetail workbench uses ReactFlow / `@xyflow/react` as the frontend graph renderer and pointer interaction layer.
  The backend `ProductWorkflow` payload remains the authority for persisted nodes and edges.
- The main workbench grid background should be rendered with ReactFlow `Background` so the visual canvas grid follows the
  ReactFlow viewport. Avoid page-level CSS grid overlays for the main workflow canvas.
- Viewport controls should use ReactFlow `Controls` / `ControlButton` instead of a page-level custom button group. Keep
  ReactFlow-native zoom in, zoom out, and fit-view behavior where possible; reserve Atelier-owned control buttons for
  business-specific actions such as reset-to-100% display and fitting the selected node group. Localize built-in control
  and minimap aria labels through ReactFlow `ariaLabelConfig`.
- Large ProductDetail canvases should use ReactFlow `MiniMap` for desktop overview. Mobile should either hide the minimap
  or expose it through an explicit mode/entry so it does not cover browse/edit/select touch flows.
- ReactFlow's internal node/edge store owns live drag coordinates during active pointer movement. ProductDetail and
  WorkflowCanvas may resync nodes/edges from backend workflow data, selection state, and optimistic drop positions through
  ReactFlow instance methods, but they must not rebuild the full node array in React state on every drag-frame position
  event.
- Canvas interaction is pointer-first: nodes move through ReactFlow drag handling and persist via
  `updateWorkflowNode(...)` on drag stop. ReactFlow node positions map directly to workflow `position_x` /
  `position_y`.
- Active node drag must visually follow the pointer, not merely the eventual persisted coordinate. Do not round active
  drag coordinates before rendering; round only the final persisted `position_x` / `position_y` values on release.
- The main workflow canvas is unbounded in both viewport panning and node coordinates. Do not apply frontend-only minimum
  `position_x` / `position_y` clamps; negative workflow coordinates are valid when the user pans or drags there. New
  nodes and templates should still be inserted at the current viewport center so they remain visible at creation time.
- Empty canvas/background areas may be dragged to pan the ReactFlow viewport. Guard node actions, edge handles/buttons,
  zoom controls, uploads, and panel resize handles so those controls do not start background panning.
- Mobile canvas interaction uses an explicit `CanvasInteractionMode`:
  `browse`, `edit`, and `select`. Mobile defaults to `browse`; desktop passes `edit` so existing mouse drag and Shift
  selection behavior stay available. In `browse`, one-finger empty-canvas drag pans the viewport and tapping a node selects
  it without starting a node drag. In `edit`, touch/pen users may drag nodes and create connections. In `select`, tapping
  nodes toggles multi-select without keyboard modifiers, one-finger blank-canvas drag still pans the viewport, and tapping
  blank canvas exits the temporary selection mode. Mobile select mode should not enable ReactFlow's selection rectangle;
  small touch screens use tap-toggle selection instead of lasso selection.
- Touch and pen canvas edits must be gated by the active mobile interaction mode. Mouse pointers keep the desktop behavior.
  ReactFlow may start visual mouse node drag immediately so the node follows the pointer without a dead zone. Keep a small
  non-zero screen-pixel guard for mouse click suppression and persisted position commits so click jitter does not persist
  accidental node movement. Touch/pen can keep a larger non-zero visual and commit threshold so tap/select sequences stay
  stable.
- Mobile pinch zoom uses ReactFlow viewport zoom, clamps through the shared workflow zoom bounds, and should preserve the
  gesture center. Pinch has higher gesture priority than pan, selection box, node drag, and connection drag.
- ProductDetail supports canvas node multi-select through local UI state. Keep `selectedNodeId` as the primary node that
  drives the Details sidebar, draft saving, reference-image fill target, and node-level run/delete/cancel/upload actions.
  Keep `selectedNodeIds` as the selected node group for group actions such as saving a node-group template, group drag,
  and group delete. Normal
  node click replaces the group with that node; Ctrl/Cmd/Shift click toggles a node in the group and makes newly added
  nodes primary; Shift-drag on empty canvas draws a transient selection rectangle and replaces the group with intersecting
  nodes. Clicking a secondary selected node without modifiers makes it the primary Details node while preserving the
  selected group. Plain empty-canvas drag must continue to pan the viewport.
- Multi-select visuals must distinguish primary and secondary selected nodes without relying on color alone. The primary
  node keeps the strong selected ring used by the Details sidebar. Secondary selected nodes use a quieter ring and a small
  check marker. The selection rectangle is a temporary translucent overlay; do not render a persistent group bounding box,
  multi-node inspector, or batch-operation panel under the multi-select contract. When more than one node is selected, a
  top-center canvas-control status such as `已选 N` should appear with a prominent red clear-selection button so the
  temporary state is obvious and not hidden by bottom scroll controls.
- Canvas keyboard selection behavior should prefer ReactFlow key props/hooks for local selection and viewport activation:
  `selectionKeyCode`, `multiSelectionKeyCode`, `panActivationKeyCode`, `zoomActivationKeyCode`, and `useKeyPress` are
  appropriate for lasso, multi-select modifiers, Space pan activation, Ctrl/Meta zoom activation, and Escape
  clear-selection. Backend-backed operations such as delete, duplicate, paste, undo, and redo remain ProductDetail-owned
  shortcuts because they require confirmation, mutation calls, cache updates, or history restoration; keep ReactFlow
  `deleteKeyCode` disabled unless those contracts are routed through Atelier handlers.
- ProductDetail node/group secondary actions must use one Atelier action model rendered through ReactFlow
  `NodeToolbar` on the selected node. The toolbar is the direct action surface on both desktop and mobile. Do not add a
  selected-card More button, mobile node action sheet, long-press action path, or Atelier desktop right-click context
  menu for node actions. Single selected reusable nodes expose run, duplicate, fit selected, and delete. A single
  `product_context` node exposes only fit selected. A selected group exposes duplicate, fit selected, save selected as
  template, and delete through one toolbar anchored to the primary selected node; secondary selected nodes do not render
  duplicate toolbars. A group that includes `product_context` exposes only duplicate and fit selected.
  Toolbar buttons must be icon buttons with `aria-label` and `title`, use `nodrag nopan nowheel`, and stay outside the
  node-card layout so they do not resize the node card. Actions such as run, duplicate, fit selected, save selected as
  template, and delete must call existing ProductDetail
  handlers/mutations: run flushes the selected draft through `handleRunWorkflow`, duplicate uses the backend duplicate
  mutation, fit selected uses WorkflowCanvas/ReactFlow fit-view helpers, template save opens the existing save-template
  form/state, and delete opens Atelier confirmation before backend mutation. A single `product_context` target should
  expose only fit-selected; a group that includes `product_context` may duplicate reusable non-product nodes, but should
  not expose node-group template save or group delete. Keep ReactFlow `deleteKeyCode` disabled and do not locally
  materialize duplicate or delete results.
- Multi-select hit testing should be based on canvas coordinates so zoom and pan do not change selection semantics. Use
  ReactFlow selection events for the main workbench and keep pure helpers for selection reconciliation. Selection state
  must reconcile when workflow data changes: deleted nodes are removed, the primary node remains included in
  `selectedNodeIds`, and a missing primary falls back to another selected node or the first workflow node.
- Treat multi-select as a temporary grouping state, not the default canvas mode. Ordinary non-group actions should collapse
  the group back to a single primary node, including blank-canvas click, adding a node, deleting a node or edge, creating
  an edge, uploading/filling a reference image, or applying a node-group template. Future save-as-template and deliberate
  group drag/delete flows consume the full `selectedNodeIds` group instead of clearing it before the operation.
- If the browser emits a click after completing a Shift-drag lasso selection, that click must not be treated as a
  blank-canvas clear action. Skip only that immediate synthetic/paired click; later blank-canvas clicks should still exit
  multi-select.
- Pointer release must not flash the node back to its stale server position. Keep the final drag coordinates in an
  optimistic position layer and update the `['product-workflow', productId]` cache before/while the PATCH is in flight;
  clear the optimistic entry after the server response becomes the authority, or restore the previous cache on error.
- Pointer releases below the Atelier click/commit guard must restore ReactFlow internal node positions to their drag
  start positions and skip persisted position mutations.
- If the same node is dropped again before an earlier position mutation resolves, protect the latest optimistic position
  from stale mutation success/error handlers; serialize or version position mutations so older responses cannot overwrite
  the newest drop and cause a one-frame old-position flash.
- Dragging any node in a multi-selected group should move every selected node by the same canvas delta, keep internal
  spacing, let ReactFlow update connected edges while dragging, allow the group to move through the unbounded canvas
  coordinate space, and persist each moved node through the normal `updateWorkflowNode(...)` position mutation. Position
  mutation success must not overwrite other pending group positions with stale full-workflow responses.
- Edges are created by dragging a ReactFlow output handle to a target handle/node. The visible temporary connection line is
  rendered by ReactFlow.
- Connection-drag handle highlighting should use ReactFlow native connection state, such as `useConnection` or
  ReactFlow-provided handle connection classes. Do not reimplement connection drag, draw a custom temporary connection
  path, or bypass Atelier's existing `onConnect` / `isValidConnection` / backend edge mutation path.
- Edge deletion is a canvas action and should use ReactFlow `EdgeToolbar` or an equivalent ReactFlow edge child for the
  delete affordance. It must call `deleteWorkflowEdge(edgeId)` before refreshing `['product-workflow', productId]`; do
  not leave stale local-only edge state.
- Node deletion is a persisted canvas action and must call `deleteWorkflowNode(nodeId)` before refreshing
  `['product-workflow', productId]`; deleting a node must not be represented by local-only filtering because connected
  edges and run history cleanup are backend responsibilities.
- Workflow execution is asynchronous from the frontend perspective: `runProductWorkflow(productId, input?)` returns the
  persisted kickoff state, then the page polls `['product-workflow', productId]` while any run is `running` or any node is
  `queued` / `running`. Run history must use backend `is_retryable` for retry actions. Cancellation belongs in the
  selected node detail actions when the selected node is part of a cancelable active run; cancel buttons call the workflow
  cancel API and must not be local-only state.
- ProductDetail run history should display both workflow-run and node-run status details. Each run card should surface
  queue/running text, `is_cancelable`, `is_retryable`, `failure_reason`, and a node-run list with node title, node type,
  node-run status, started/finished timestamps, and node-run failure reason. Image-generation prompt review may be exposed
  as an explicit button on the corresponding node-run row; do not render raw `output_json`, artifact ids, or prompt text
  inline in the normal log.
- ProductDetail run history may display workflow image-provider summaries from `nodeRun.output_json.provider_results`
  when present. Keep this as a compact summary only: provider/model, provider response status/id, actual size, and
  provider compatibility notes are acceptable; raw provider request/output JSON, prompts, API keys, base URLs, and artifact
  ids must stay hidden. Do not imply live provider progress unless the workflow API exposes durable node-run progress
  fields.
- Running any workflow node must first flush the currently selected dirty inspector draft, even when the clicked run action
  belongs to a different node. Otherwise a user can edit the product context node and immediately run an image node from
  the canvas before autosave persists the newest product fields.
- Do not use workflow active state as a global node-run lock. Split interaction busy state so the full-workflow run button
  and structural mutations can be disabled during active runs, while individual node run buttons are disabled only when
  that node is already `queued` / `running` or a run submission is currently pending. Node dragging remains available
  unless a layout/position mutation is already pending.
- When an active run transitions to inactive, refresh artifact-bearing queries: `['product', productId]`,
  `['product-history', productId]`, and `['products']`.
- Product creation is intentionally minimal: only product name and preview/main image are required; category, price,
  description/context, reference images, copy, and image directions are configured later through canvas nodes.
- Product list deletion must use `api.deleteProduct(productId)`, ask for explicit confirmation, and refresh `['products']`
  after success. Show `ApiError.detail` when active workflow runs block deletion.
- `reference_image` nodes use `uploadWorkflowNodeImage(...)` for manual uploads and can also be filled by upstream
  `image_generation` nodes.
- A `reference_image` node is a single current-image slot. When manual upload or upstream `image_generation` fills a slot,
  the UI should treat the returned single `source_asset_ids[0]` / `image_asset_ids[0]` as the node's current image and rely
  on product source-asset/history artifact surfaces for older replaced assets. Do not hide multi-image output only in the
  frontend; the backend contract must replace the node output.
- `image_generation` is a trigger/config node, not an image-bearing artifact node. It must not render generated-image
  previews or download links on the image-generation card itself.
- `image_generation` output count is represented by downstream graph slots: one generated image per connected downstream
  `reference_image` node. With no downstream slots, backend execution fails with a concise "connect at least one
  image/reference node" message; the frontend should make that requirement visible in the inspector.
- Any node with an image asset/output should render a compact preview directly on the node card.
- Any user-visible product/workbench image preview should provide an explicit `下载` action. Do not rely on browser
  right-click as the only way to retrieve product images.
- Type-specific inspector forms are required for product context, reference image, copy generation, and image generation;
  avoid generic JSON editors for normal user flows.
- A selected `copy_generation` node with a generated `copy_set_id` must edit `CopyPayloadV2` as the primary copy model:
  `summary`, `content.kind`, block/section text, labels, notes, and visual hints. The inspector must not show a derived
  fixed-field copy panel or maintain removed copy fields as draft state. Saving calls
  `updateWorkflowNodeCopy(...)` with `structured_payload`, refreshes workflow/product artifacts, and does not expose the
  raw `copy_set_id`.
- Node output details should stay productized and minimal. Do not render raw `output_json` keys, artifact IDs, prompt /
  instruction text, generated-summary prose, or technical fact-chip piles in the normal inspector; keep failure reasons
  visible and expose successful artifacts through their productized surfaces (node thumbnails, editable copy fields, and
  the Images tab).
- ProductDetail uses one right sidebar for Details, Runs, Images, and Templates. The small rail selects the active tab; clicking a
  workflow node must select it and switch the sidebar to Details. Workflow completion must refresh artifacts silently and
  must not auto-switch the active tab.
- The Images tab may aggregate `PosterVariant` and `SourceAsset` records, but it must de-duplicate generated images that
  appear as both a persisted poster and a filled reference source asset from the same `image_generation` output.
- In the Images tab, thumbnail primary click opens a large in-app preview/lightbox using preview/full URLs; it must not
  navigate to, download, or expose the compressed thumbnail as the primary action. Explicit `下载` controls still use
  original/download URLs.
- When the selected node is `reference_image`, Images tab cards expose a concise fill action. SourceAsset-backed cards
  call `bindWorkflowNodeImage(..., { source_asset_id })` so no duplicate upload is created. PosterVariant-backed cards
  should pass the already paired filled SourceAsset id when workflow output exposes one, otherwise call
  `bindWorkflowNodeImage(..., { poster_variant_id })` so the backend can materialize a reference SourceAsset.
- Images tab de-duplication should read every durable poster-to-SourceAsset mapping available: generated image-node
  `generated_poster_variant_ids` / `filled_source_asset_ids`, filled reference-node `source_poster_variant_id`, and
  SourceAsset `source_poster_variant_id`. Do not rely only on currently filled reference nodes; old materialized poster
  SourceAssets remain implementation artifacts and must stay hidden when their source PosterVariant is already shown. The
  backend materialized poster filename convention `poster-{poster_variant_id}.*` is only a legacy fallback when an older
  API payload lacks the explicit SourceAsset field; do not apply it when `source_poster_variant_id` is present and null, or
  user-uploaded reference images with the same filename would be over-filtered.
- Image download links should use `download_url` when available and fall back to preview URLs only when needed. Always pass
  backend URLs through `api.toApiUrl(...)`, use short visible copy such as `下载`, stop propagation inside node cards, and
  sanitize generated filenames so product names cannot introduce path separators or control characters.
- User-visible copy should be short utility labels such as `商品`, `参考图`, `文案`, `生图`, `运行`, `连接`, `删除`.
- An idle `product_context` node is usable static context and should not be labeled as `未运行`; display it as available
  context while leaving real generative/action nodes to use the generic idle label.
- Mutations that create artifacts must refresh `['product', productId]`, `['product-history', productId]`, and
  `['products']` when outputs can affect copy, posters, or list status.

### Templates Sidebar Tab

- Built-in canvas templates are loaded through `api.listCanvasTemplates()` from `GET /api/workflow/canvas-templates`;
  ProductDetail should display built-in scenario templates and non-archived user templates for workbench insertion.
- ProductDetail must present templates inside the inspector sidebar as a `templates` tab with the same rail
  behavior as Details, Runs, and Images. Do not open a canvas floating palette for templates.
- The collapsed sidebar rail must include a Templates tab entry; clicking it expands the sidebar and switches to the
  Templates tab.
- Template cards should make a real mini-map the primary visual: render a taller node-editor-like preview with a subtle
  dotted/grid background, compact node rectangles, visible edge paths, and only short labels/chips below it. Avoid
  explanatory paragraphs, long suggested-connection copy, or dense fact lists in the sidebar.
- The mini-map node cards should echo `WorkflowNodeCard` visual language: white or white/95 surfaces, slate/zinc borders,
  rounded card corners, type-matched lucide icons, short title plus `NODE_LABELS`, compact status pills, and left/right
  handle dots. Do not regress to color-strip-plus-lines nodes.
- Template card previews must be rendered from catalog summary `preview_nodes` and `preview_edges`, which are derived from
  backend `CanvasTemplate.nodes` and `CanvasTemplate.edges`. Use the provided relative coordinates to fit the graph into
  the sidebar card as a real mini-map. Do not hard-code a generic template structure in the frontend, and show a short
  empty state when preview data is absent.
- Template card mini-maps must remain readable for built-in scenario templates: node rectangles must not overlap, edge
  paths should render behind nodes with enough visible space between columns, and the preview can increase height or use
  a normalized column layout while still deriving nodes/edges from the backend summary.
- Template cards should display backend `default_external_connections` as short chips such as `自动接商品`. These chips
  describe edges that the apply API will persist; they are not long-form instructions.
- Template summaries include `source: "builtin" | "user"` and nullable `user_template_id`. ProductDetail must show a
  concise source marker, expose rename/delete actions only for `source === "user"` templates, and leave built-in templates
  immutable.
- When more than one canvas node is selected, the top-center multi-select control may open a save-template form. The form
  requires a template name, accepts an optional description, calls
  `api.createUserTemplateGroup(productId, { title, description, node_ids: selectedNodeIds })`, invalidates
  `["canvas-templates"]` on success, and switches the sidebar to Templates so the saved template is visible.
- Deleting a user template calls `api.archiveUserTemplateGroup(user_template_id)` after user confirmation and invalidates
  `["canvas-templates"]`; UI text may say delete, but the backend operation is archival.
- Renaming a user template calls `api.updateUserTemplateGroup(user_template_id, { title })` and invalidates
  `["canvas-templates"]`. The first UI contract only edits the title; description editing can stay out of the card flow.
- Applying a built-in scenario template calls `api.applyWorkflowTemplateGroup(productId, { template_key, position_x,
  position_y })` and receives the normal `ProductWorkflow` response. Built-in full-canvas templates reuse the active
  workflow's existing product node instead of creating a second product node.
- Applying a user node-group template uses the same API with `template_key === "user:{id}"`; the frontend must not special
  case materialization locally.
- Use the current viewport-center node position for the insertion point unless a more explicit user-selected canvas
  coordinate is part of a future task.
- On apply success, update `['product-workflow', productId]`, refresh the workflow query, and select a created primary
  node by comparing pre/post node IDs. Prefer `copy_generation`, then `image_generation`, then the first created node so
  the user can immediately edit, connect, drag, or run it.
- Display `reference_input_hints`, `output_slots`, and `suggested_connections` as guidance only. Suggested connections
  must not become hidden external edges; every real edge in the canvas should come from the backend workflow payload.
- When a user or legacy node-group template declares default external connections, adding it should result in visible backend-returned
  workflow edges, for example from the existing product context node to newly created copy/image nodes. The frontend must
  render those edges from the normal workflow payload rather than from local template metadata.
- Do not duplicate the backend template catalog in ProductDetail. The page may use merchant-facing labels from the API,
  but the submitted `template_key` must be the backend-recognized key.

### Keyboard Shortcuts and Undo/Redo

#### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: ProductDetail changes to keyboard handling, selected node groups, copy/paste, delete shortcuts, or undo/redo.
- Shortcuts are local workbench interactions on top of persisted workflow mutations.

#### 2. Signatures
- Copy: `Ctrl/Cmd+C` stores the current selected node ids in page memory.
- Paste: `Ctrl/Cmd+V` calls `api.duplicateWorkflowNodeGroup(productId, ...)`.
- Duplicate: `Ctrl/Cmd+D` copies and immediately duplicates the current selected group.
- Delete: `Delete` / `Backspace` requests confirmation, then deletes the selected node/group through persisted APIs.
- Undo: `Ctrl/Cmd+Z` applies the latest frontend inverse action.
- Redo: `Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+Z` or `Ctrl/Cmd+Y` reapplies the latest undone inverse action.
- Backend duplicate endpoint: `POST /api/products/{product_id}/workflow/node-groups/duplicate`.

#### 3. Contracts
- Shortcut handling must ignore events from `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `button`, `a`, labels, role buttons,
  contenteditable elements, and node/action controls where text editing or normal browser commands should win.
- Shortcuts operate on the current `selectedNodeIds`; no selection means no destructive action.
- Delete shortcut always opens confirmation. Undo/redo opens confirmation only when the step will delete nodes or edges.
  Movement, restoration, copy, and paste execute without confirmation.
- Copy/paste and duplicate must use backend duplication. The frontend must not locally materialize workflow rows.
- After paste/duplicate, update `['product-workflow', productId]` with the backend response and select the created nodes.
- Undo/redo history is an in-memory inverse-action stack scoped to the current product page. Clear it on product changes
  and when workflow data is externally refreshed in a way that makes local history unsafe.
- Undoing node deletion restores structure, editable config, and internal edges only. It must not restore output JSON, run
  state, workflow run rows, generated copy, generated images, or artifact ids/URLs/paths.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Shortcut from editable target -> do nothing and do not prevent the user's text operation.
- Delete with no selected nodes -> do nothing.
- Paste with empty clipboard -> do nothing or show a concise local notice; do not call the backend.
- Backend duplicate error -> show `ApiError.detail` in the existing ProductDetail error surface.
- Destructive undo/redo canceled by user -> keep history unchanged.
- Undo/redo mutation failure -> show `ApiError.detail` and keep the page consistent with the latest query data.

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: select a copy/image/reference chain, press `Ctrl/Cmd+D`, and see a new selected chain with internal edges.
- Good: delete selected nodes with confirmation, then undo and get fresh idle/configured nodes without old outputs.
- Base: pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+C` inside an inspector text field uses normal text copy and does not replace the canvas
  clipboard.
- Bad: storing copied workflow nodes in localStorage or sharing them across products/tabs for the MVP.
- Bad: undoing deletion by writing old `output_json` back into a node, which makes stale generated artifacts look valid.

#### 6. Tests Required
- Pure helper tests for shortcut target filtering and shortcut key classification.
- Pure helper tests for undo/redo inverse-action stack behavior and artifact-field sanitization.
- ProductDetail or focused tests that delete and destructive undo/redo request confirmation.
- Frontend build must pass because shortcut routes touch DTOs, API helpers, and ProductDetail.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```tsx
document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  if (event.metaKey && event.key === "c") setClipboard(selectedNodeIds);
});
```

This steals normal copy behavior from inspector fields.

Correct:

```tsx
if (!isWorkflowShortcutBlockedTarget(event.target)) {
  handleWorkflowShortcut(event);
}
```

Filter editable/action targets before interpreting canvas shortcuts.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- API `ApiError.detail` is shown near the workflow action.
- Missing workflow while loading -> loading state, not an empty destructive reset.
- Active workflow polling stops when no run is `running` and no node is `queued` / `running`; `cancelled` runs are
  terminal and should not keep polling alive.
- Deleting a node during an active workflow run -> show backend `运行中，稍后删除`; do not locally remove it.
- Deleting a product during active workflow runs -> show backend detail; do not locally remove it until the API succeeds.
- Unsupported node config fields stay in `config_json` and are not force-cast to narrower frontend-only types.
- Image URLs from workflow-created source assets and poster artifacts still go through `api.toApiUrl(...)`.
- Direct image runs without downstream reference slots should show the backend error near the workflow action/node; do not
  invent a fallback preview on the image-generation node.
- Image-size inputs smaller than the provider-safe lower bound must be calibrated in the picker before submission, matching
  the backend 512px minimum per side. The user-facing custom-size hint should show the calibrated final output.
- When async workflow polling observes a failed run with `failure_reason`, ProductDetail should surface that reason in the
  global workflow error area as well as node/run detail surfaces.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: selecting a node updates the inspector without navigating away from the product detail page.
- Good: an image-generation node with no downstream reference slot fails clearly and shows no generated image
  preview/download on the image node.
- Good: an image-generation node connected to two downstream reference slots visibly fills both slot nodes after run.
- Base: adding a copy/image/reference branch creates a node, then connects it with an edge through API helpers.
- Base: after a copy node run succeeds, editing the generated copy updates the inspector draft from product `copy_sets`
  plus node output, without showing raw output summaries or artifact IDs in the normal inspector.
- Base: uploading an image in a `reference_image` inspector refreshes the workflow query and keeps the node output visible
  after a page reload.
- Base: after dragging a node and releasing the pointer, the rendered node stays at the dropped position while the
  position mutation is pending; it must not briefly render the old `position_x` / `position_y`.
- Base: dragging an empty canvas/background area pans the ReactFlow viewport, while dragging a node still persists node
  coordinates and clicking edge/delete/run/upload/zoom controls does not move the viewport.
- Base: on desktop, Shift-dragging an empty canvas area uses the ReactFlow selection rectangle and replaces the selected
  node group, while a normal empty-canvas drag still pans.
- Base: on mobile, select mode uses tap-toggle multi-select, keeps empty-canvas drag as viewport pan, and does not show a
  selection rectangle.
- Base: multi-selecting nodes does not turn Details into a batch editor; `selectedNodeId` remains the primary node and
  `selectedNodeIds` remains the group for future template saving or batch actions.
- Base: clicking a secondary selected node opens that node in Details while keeping the group selected; clicking blank
  canvas or performing ordinary node/edge/image mutations exits multi-select back to one primary node.
- Base: dragging a secondary selected node makes it primary for Details but keeps the group selected and moves the whole
  selected group.
- Base: deleting from the multi-select control confirms once, calls backend node deletion for selected nodes, and exits to
  a single remaining primary node after success.
- Base: while a workflow run is active, users can still drag nodes to reorganize the canvas and may run another
  non-queued/non-running node; the backend rejects overlapping planned nodes and the UI still blocks unsafe structural
  changes.
- Base: deleting a node removes it and its connected edges after the backend response, and a page refresh does not restore
  the node.
- Base: deleting a product from the product list removes it after API success and a direct detail load returns not found.
- Base: visible product images, filled reference-slot images, and image-history thumbnails each expose a concise `下载`
  action that does not select/drag the node or open the preview modal as a side effect. Image-generation nodes do not expose
  generated-image downloads directly.
- Base: with a reference-image node selected, filling from a SourceAsset updates the workflow cache to the chosen
  `source_asset_id`; filling from a PosterVariant either reuses its paired SourceAsset id or relies on the backend
  materialization endpoint.
- Bad: keeping workflow nodes in local-only state; refresh would lose the DAG and break run history.
- Bad: treating `workflowActive` as `runBusy` for every node run button; that hides the backend's ability to run disjoint
  nodes and makes the UI look globally locked while only one node is active.

### 6. Tests Required

- `just web-build` must pass after any DTO or page change.
- Backend API tests should cover workflow payload shapes; the frontend relies on these typed shapes at build time.
- User-template frontend changes must pass `just web-build` because `CanvasTemplateSummary`, API helpers, ProductDetail,
  and `TemplateGroupsPanel` all share DTO fields.
- If a separate frontend test runner is added later, cover selected-node inspector, run-all mutation, edge drag/delete, and
  cache invalidation.
- If a separate frontend test runner is added later, cover workflow active-run polling, active-to-inactive artifact query
  refresh, node deletion, and product list deletion error/success states.
- Drag-position regressions should cover the render priority: active drag position, then optimistic dropped position, then
  server workflow position.
- Multi-select regressions should cover desktop rectangle normalization/intersection, node hit testing with
  measured/fallback bounds, modifier-toggle behavior, lasso replacement behavior, mobile tap-toggle behavior, and
  selection reconciliation after workflow node changes.
- Multi-select regressions should also cover secondary-node focus and clearing the group for ordinary non-group actions.
- User-template regressions should cover saving from `selectedNodeIds`, invalidating `["canvas-templates"]`, showing
  user-only rename/delete actions, confirming archival, and applying user templates through the same template-group API as
  built-ins.
- Download-link regressions should cover URL construction through `api.toApiUrl(...)`, filename sanitization, and event
  propagation isolation inside node cards.
- Images-tab regressions should cover preview/lightbox primary click, explicit download action, gallery de-duplication, and
  reference-node fill cache refresh for both `source_asset_id` and `poster_variant_id` inputs.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const [nodes, setNodes] = useState(defaultNodes);
```

Local-only nodes do not satisfy the persisted Atelier workflow contract.

#### Correct

```ts
const workflowQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["product-workflow", productId],
  queryFn: () => api.getProductWorkflow(productId),
});
```

Load the persisted workflow and keep only transient selection/edit drafts in local state.

#### Wrong

```tsx
Object.entries(node.output_json).map(([key, value]) => <div>{key}: {String(value)}</div>);
```

This leaks internal artifact IDs and prompt-like implementation detail into the product UI.

#### Correct

```tsx
const facts = [`图片 ${posterCount}`, `参考图 ${filledCount}`, size].filter(Boolean);
```

Render concise, user-facing facts and keep raw workflow JSON as an API/debug boundary, not normal UI copy.

#### Wrong

```tsx
setNodeDrag(null);
updateWorkflowNode(node.id, { position_x: x, position_y: y });
```

If the render path falls back to the still-stale query data after `setNodeDrag(null)`, the node flashes back to the old
position until the mutation/refetch completes.

#### Correct

```tsx
setOptimisticNodePositions((positions) => ({ ...positions, [node.id]: { x, y } }));
queryClient.setQueryData(["product-workflow", productId], moveNodeInCache(node.id, x, y));
updateWorkflowNode(node.id, { position_x: x, position_y: y });
```

Keep a short-lived optimistic coordinate and cache update during the mutation, then replace it with the server-returned
workflow on success or restore the previous cache on error.

#### Wrong

```tsx
const busy = runWorkflowMutation.isPending || updateNodePositionMutation.isPending;
if (busy) return;
```

This makes a long async workflow run feel like a frozen canvas even though persisted run/node status is available through
polling.

#### Correct

```tsx
const workflowActive = hasActiveWorkflow(workflow);
const runSubmissionPending = runWorkflowMutation.isPending || retryWorkflowRunMutation.isPending;
const selectedNodeRunAction = getWorkflowNodeRunActionState(selectedNode, {
  runSubmissionPending,
  pendingStartNodeId,
});
const dragBusy = updateNodePositionMutation.isPending;
const structureBusy = layoutMutationBusy || workflowActive;
```

Use persisted workflow activity to control polling and unsafe structural mutations. Use node status plus submission
pending state for individual node run actions, while keeping layout dragging independent from provider execution.

## Scenario: Autosaved direct image workbench

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: ProductDetail workbench changes for image-node execution, autosave, panel sizing, or canvas zoom.

### 2. Signatures
- `api.listProducts({ page, page_size })` drives paginated product lists and returns thumbnail URLs.
- `api.runProductWorkflow(productId, { start_node_id })` may target an image node whose only required upstream is product
  context.
- Local UI persistence keys: `atelier.workflow.zoom` and `atelier.workflow.inspectorWidth`.

### 3. Contracts
- The add-node toolbar must not expose `product_context`; one product context exists per active workflow.
- Node draft edits debounce-save through `updateWorkflowNode(...)`; run-all and run-selected must flush the selected draft
  before calling `runProductWorkflow(...)`.
- Image-node inspector copy should only show the downstream reference-slot requirement when no slot is connected; do not
  show internal graph counts such as upstream-node totals. Node cards should show status and any failure reason, not
  generated-summary prose, raw coordinates, or image previews for `image_generation` nodes.
- ReactFlow viewport zoom transforms visual coordinates, while drag persistence must keep backend positions in unscaled
  workflow coordinates.
- Mouse wheel and pinch events inside the canvas viewport should zoom the ReactFlow canvas within shared zoom bounds and
  persist the value under `atelier.workflow.zoom`. Controls/forms/buttons should not trigger unexpected zoom.
- The shared minimum zoom must be low enough for mobile all-nodes overview. Do not set a floor such as 50% that prevents
  ReactFlow `fitView` from fitting the current workflow into a narrow mobile viewport.
- Canvas zoom controls must be a floating overlay anchored inside the ReactFlow canvas viewport through ReactFlow `Panel`
  or an equivalent ReactFlow child component. Zoom display should read ReactFlow viewport state through native hooks such
  as `useViewport`, and durable zoom persistence should be tied to ReactFlow viewport change end events.
- Canvas view-fitting controls should use ReactFlow instance viewport helpers such as `fitView` with node id filters for
  all-nodes and selected-node focus. Do not calculate viewport transforms manually for these standard view operations.
- Run history and downloadable images live in the right sidebar, not in a persistent bottom panel, so the canvas keeps its
  vertical working space.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Autosave error -> show local `ApiError.detail`, keep user draft visible, and allow explicit retry/save.
- Run clicked while selected draft is dirty -> save first; if save fails, do not run stale config.
- Zoomed canvas drag -> persisted `position_x` / `position_y` are unscaled workflow coordinates.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: edit image instruction, immediately click run, and backend receives the new instruction.
- Base: resize the right sidebar, refresh, and see the same local width.
- Base: pan or zoom the canvas and the zoom controls stay visually anchored over the canvas viewport.
- Bad: showing generated image preview/download on an `image_generation` node instead of on linked reference slots.
- Bad: placing zoom controls in the top toolbar or scrollable canvas flow so they move with workflow content.

### 6. Tests Required
- `just web-build` for DTO/type compatibility.
- Backend API tests for direct image-node run and singleton product context, because frontend relies on those contracts.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct
#### Wrong

```tsx
onClick={() => runWorkflowMutation.mutate(selectedNode.id)}
```

#### Correct

```tsx
onClick={() => void handleRunWorkflow(selectedNode.id)} // flushes selected draft first
```
