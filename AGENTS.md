# Trellis Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

This project is managed by Trellis. The working knowledge you need lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/workflow.md` — development phases, when to create tasks, skill routing
- `.trellis/spec/` — package- and layer-scoped coding guidelines (read before writing code in a given layer)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals and session traces
- `.trellis/tasks/` — active and archived tasks (PRDs, research, jsonl context)

If a Trellis command is available on your platform (e.g. `/trellis:finish-work`, `/trellis:continue`), prefer it over manual steps. Not every platform exposes every command.

If you're using Codex or another agent-capable tool, additional project-scoped helpers may live in:
- `.agents/skills/` — reusable Trellis skills
- `.codex/agents/` — optional custom subagents

Managed by Trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved; edits inside may be overwritten by a future `trellis update`.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Atelier is a private single-merchant workspace. The backend lives in `backend/src/productflow_backend/` and uses clear layers: `presentation/` for FastAPI routes and schemas, `application/` for use cases, `domain/` for enums/core concepts, and `infrastructure/` for database, storage, queues, text/image providers, and poster rendering. Alembic migrations are in `backend/alembic/versions/`; backend tests are in `backend/tests/`. The React/Vite app lives in `web/src/`, with pages in `web/src/pages/`, shared UI in `web/src/components/`, and API/type helpers in `web/src/lib/`. Product and architecture notes live in `docs/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use the root `justfile` whenever possible:

- `just backend-install` — install backend dependencies with `uv` dev extras.
- `docker compose up -d` — start local PostgreSQL and Redis.
- `just backend-migrate` — apply Alembic migrations with dev env vars.
- `just backend-run` — run the FastAPI API on the dev port.
- `just backend-worker` — run Dramatiq workers for async jobs.
- `just backend-test` — run backend pytest tests.
- `just web-install` — install frontend dependencies with pnpm.
- `just web-dev` — run Vite with the API proxy configured.
- `just web-build` — type-check and build the frontend.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Python targets 3.12 and uses Ruff with 120-character lines plus `E`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, and `B` lint rules. Keep imports sorted, prefer typed functions, and name modules/functions in `snake_case`. React components and pages use `PascalCase` filenames, such as `ProductListPage.tsx`; hooks, helpers, and API functions use `camelCase`. Keep provider-specific code behind infrastructure factories instead of leaking it into routes.

## Testing Guidelines
Backend tests use pytest and are discovered from `backend/tests/` as `test_*.py`. Add workflow-level coverage when changing product, copy, poster, settings, or image-session behavior. Run `just backend-test` before backend commits and `just web-build` before frontend commits. For schema or migration changes, include both an Alembic revision and a regression test where practical.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history mixes Conventional Commit prefixes (`feat:`, `chore:`) with concise Chinese summaries. Use one focused commit per topic, for example `feat: 增加设置页模型配置`. Pull requests should describe the user-visible change, list verification commands, call out migrations/config changes, and include screenshots for UI updates.

## Documentation Style
Official docs, release notes, PR descriptions, and contribution guidance must stay concrete and verifiable. Avoid templated delivery copy and empty contrast/progress scaffolding:

- Do not use Chinese patterns like “这不是……而是……”, “不是……而是……”, “先把……打通”, or promotional “先……再……”.
- Do not use English patterns like “This is not ..., but ...”, “not ..., but ...”, “establishes the main loop”, or promotional “first ..., then ...”.
- Keep real technical sequencing when it matters, such as command order, migration steps, auto-save before run, and troubleshooting steps.
- State current facts and verified results; label future direction as unimplemented or planned.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Do not commit `.env`, `web/.env`, generated storage, caches, or build output. Keep secrets in files copied from `.env.example` / `web/.env.example`. Runtime database settings may override selected provider/model options, while `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, and `ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY` remain env-only.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs are tracked in GitHub Issues for `yuqie6/ProductFlow`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Triage uses the default five-label vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, and `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Domain documentation uses a single-context layout: root `CONTEXT.md` plus `docs/adr/` when they exist. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
